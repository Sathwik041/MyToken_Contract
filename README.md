# SATH_TOKEN (SATHWIKCOIN)

SATH_TOKEN is a custom ERC20-style smart contract written in Solidity, designed to demonstrate core token mechanics such as minting, transfers, approvals, and delegated transfers using the allowance model.

The contract is deployed on the Monad Testnet and follows widely adopted ERC20 patterns, including event-based tracking for compatibility with wallets and blockchain explorers.

## Key Highlights
- Owner-controlled token minting
- Direct peer-to-peer token transfers
- Allowance-based delegated transfers (`approve` / `transferFrom`)
- Event-driven tracking using `Transfer` and `Approval`
- Lightweight, readable, and educational implementation

## Use Cases
- Learning and understanding ERC20 internals
- Smart contract development practice
- Testnet experiments and demos
- Web3 portfolio and academic projects
